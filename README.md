# ToDoList_Project
VIEW HERE *https://khuziamar.github.io/ToDoList_Project/*

This is a Web Application I built using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript/jQuery

The Goal of this project was to make an interactive site that functions as a todo list!
The user can add items to the list by 

1) clicking "Add new Todo"

2) typing the new task and hitting enter

The user can also cross out the tasks by simply clicking on them!
In addition, the user can click the trashcan displayed in red to delete any tasks permanently! 

This project was inspired by The Web Development Boot Camp by Colt Steele
